## Diffusion

This is an iOS app which uses [Facebook Auth](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login), [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a backend to serve as an application to connect students with other students (who are pros at subject topics). This application allows a student to make a new post about what help they need along with the subject that they need assistance with. The expert of said-subject will get a notification from the app about that post and the recipient can choose to either accept and ask for their location or pass it.

## Current status of development

This application is currently still under development but the code freeze date is still `To Be Determined`.

### Important notice

The master `branch` will serve as the release cycle branch but all other branches of development will be hidden.
